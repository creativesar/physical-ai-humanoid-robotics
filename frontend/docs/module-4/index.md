# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

This module explores Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that enable humanoid robots to perceive, understand, and interact with the world using combined visual, linguistic, and motor capabilities. Students will learn to develop robots that can understand natural language commands and perform complex tasks in real-world environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand VLA architectures and their applications in robotics
- Implement vision-language models for robotic perception
- Develop action planning systems that connect language understanding to motor control
- Create multimodal systems that integrate vision, language, and action
- Build human-robot interaction systems using natural language
- Deploy VLA models for real-time robotic applications
