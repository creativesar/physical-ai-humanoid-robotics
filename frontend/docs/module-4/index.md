# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. In this module, we'll explore Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, which represent the next generation of embodied AI for robotics. VLA systems integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic action in a unified framework, enabling robots to understand and execute complex commands in natural language while perceiving and interacting with their environment.

Vision-Language-Action models represent a paradigm shift from traditional robotics approaches, where perception, language, and action were treated as separate modules. Instead, VLA systems learn joint representations that connect visual input, linguistic commands, and motor actions, enabling more natural and intuitive human-robot interaction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamentals of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
2. Implement voice-to-action systems using speech recognition and language models
3. Apply cognitive planning for translating natural language to robotic actions
4. Design capstone projects for autonomous humanoid robots
5. Explore the convergence of LLMs and robotics
6. Integrate multimodal perception for enhanced robot understanding
7. Implement conversational robotics capabilities
8. Develop embodied AI systems that combine vision, language, and action
