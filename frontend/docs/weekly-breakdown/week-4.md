# Week 4: ROS 2 Packages, Workspaces & Humanoid Robotics Integration

## Overview
This week focuses on organizing ROS 2 code using packages and workspaces, and begins integrating ROS 2 concepts with humanoid robotics applications. Students will learn to structure their code for complex robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages effectively
- Organize code using ROS 2 workspaces
- Apply ROS 2 concepts to humanoid robot systems
- Implement modular and reusable code components
- Understand package dependencies and build systems

## Topics Covered
1. ROS 2 Package Creation and Management
2. Workspace Organization and Build Systems
3. Humanoid Robotics Applications with ROS 2
4. Package Dependencies and Build Tools

## Required Reading
- ROS 2 package and workspace documentation
- Module 1 content on packages and workspaces
- Best practices for ROS 2 project organization

## Activities
- Create a complete ROS 2 package for humanoid robot control
- Organize multiple packages in a workspace
- Implement reusable components for humanoid robots
- Practice build and dependency management

## Assessment
- Complete ROS 2 package for humanoid robot application
- Workspace organization and build process
