# Week 3: Advanced ROS 2 - Nodes, Communication & Tools

## Overview
This week delves deeper into ROS 2's communication mechanisms, advanced node development, and essential tools for debugging and monitoring robotic systems. Students will build more complex ROS 2 applications.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Implement complex ROS 2 node interactions
- Use advanced message passing patterns
- Apply ROS 2 tools for system monitoring and debugging
- Understand Quality of Service (QoS) settings
- Develop robust ROS 2 applications for humanoid robots

## Topics Covered
1. Advanced Node Development
2. Quality of Service (QoS) Settings
3. ROS 2 Tools and Debugging
4. Best Practices for ROS 2 Development
