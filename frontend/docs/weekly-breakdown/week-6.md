# Week 6: Gazebo Environment Setup & Robot Modeling

## Overview
This week focuses on creating and configuring Gazebo environments for humanoid robot simulation. Students will learn to build detailed robot models and environments that accurately represent real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Create detailed 3D robot models for Gazebo
- Design realistic simulation environments
- Configure physics properties and sensors
- Implement robot control interfaces in simulation
- Validate simulation accuracy

## Topics Covered
1. Robot Model Creation and URDF
2. Gazebo Environment Design
3. Physics Configuration and Sensors
4. Simulation Validation and Testing

## Required Reading
- Module 2 content on robot modeling
- Gazebo physics and sensor documentation
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) specifications

## Activities
- Create a humanoid robot model in URDF
- Design a complex simulation environment
- Configure sensors and actuators
- Test robot behavior in simulation

## Assessment
- Complete humanoid robot model in Gazebo
- Functional simulation environment with physics
