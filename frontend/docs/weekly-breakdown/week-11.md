# Week 11: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems Introduction

## Overview
This week introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, which enable robots to understand natural language commands and execute complex tasks based on visual input. Students will explore the integration of vision, language, and action systems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Understand the concept of Vision-Language-Action systems
- Explore VLA architectures and models
- Implement basic language-to-action systems
- Integrate visual perception with language understanding
- Design multimodal robotic systems

## Topics Covered
1. Vision-Language-Action Architecture
2. VLA Models and Frameworks
3. Language-to-Action Systems
4. Multimodal Integration

## Required Reading
- Module 4 content on Vision-Language-Action (though skipped in implementation)
- VLA system documentation
- Multimodal AI for robotics

## Activities
- Explore VLA model architectures
- Implement basic language understanding
- Design vision-language integration
- Create simple action execution systems

## Assessment
- Basic VLA system design
- Language-to-action implementation
