# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots. ROS 2 provides the communication framework, tools, and capabilities needed to develop complex robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages and workspaces
- Implement communication between robotic components using topics, services, and actions
- Design distributed robotic systems using ROS 2's middleware
- Integrate sensors and actuators with ROS 2 nodes
