# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. In this module, we'll explore the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for modern robots. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure, tools, and libraries necessary to build complex robotic applications.

ROS 2 is a middleware framework that enables different software components (nodes) to communicate with each other through topics, services, and actions. It's designed to support the development of distributed robotic systems with features like real-time support, security, and multi-platform compatibility.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand the core concepts and architecture of ROS 2
2. Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. Build ROS 2 packages with Python
4. Use launch files and parameter management
5. Bridge Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
6. Understand URDF for humanoid robot description
