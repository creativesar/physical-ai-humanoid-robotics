# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

This module explores digital twin technology for humanoid robotics, focusing on simulation environments using Gazebo and Unity. Digital twins enable safe testing, development, and validation of robotic systems in virtual environments before deployment to physical hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create realistic robot models and environments for simulation
- Integrate Unity for advanced visualization and human-robot interaction
- Develop physics-based simulations with accurate robot dynamics
- Connect simulation environments to real robotic systems using ROS 2
- Validate robotic algorithms in virtual environments
