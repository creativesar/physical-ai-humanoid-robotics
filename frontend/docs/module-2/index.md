# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. In this module, we'll explore the concept of digital twins in robotics and learn how to create high-fidelity simulations using Gazebo and Unity. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that allow us to test, validate, and optimize robotic behaviors in a safe, controlled environment before deploying them to real hardware.

Simulation is a critical component of modern robotics development, enabling rapid prototyping, algorithm testing, and safety validation without the risks and costs associated with physical hardware testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Set up Gazebo simulation environments for robotic systems
2. Understand URDF and SDF robot description formats
3. Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
4. Work with sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
5. Create high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
6. Understand sim-to-real transfer techniques
7. Apply simulation for robot development and validation
