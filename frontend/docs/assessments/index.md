# Assessments & Evaluations

This section contains all the assessments, evaluations, and practical exercises for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. These assessments are designed to test your understanding of the concepts covered in each module and provide hands-on experience with the technologies discussed.

## Assessment Structure

The assessments are organized by module and include:

- **Theoretical Questions**: Conceptual understanding of robotics principles
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on implementation tasks
- **Project-Based Assignments**: Comprehensive projects that integrate multiple concepts
- **Simulation Challenges**: Tasks to be completed in simulation environments

## Assessment Types

### Module-Specific Assessments
Each module contains specific assessments tailored to the topics covered:

- **Module 1**: ROS 2 practical exercises and communication pattern challenges
- **Module 2**: Simulation environment creation and digital twin implementation
- **Module 3**: AI model deployment and perception system challenges
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action system integration tasks

### Integrated Projects
Advanced projects that require knowledge from multiple modules:

- **Humanoid Robot Control System**: Design and implement a complete control system
- **Autonomous Navigation Challenge**: Create an AI-powered navigation system
- **Multi-Robot Coordination**: Implement coordination between multiple robotic agents

## Evaluation Criteria

Assessments will be evaluated based on:

- **Technical Accuracy**: Correct implementation of concepts and technologies
- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-documented, and maintainable code
