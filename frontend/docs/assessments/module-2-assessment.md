# Module 2 Assessment - Digital Twins & Simulation

This assessment covers the concepts of digital twins and simulation environments as introduced in Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity).

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assessment, you should be able to:

- Create and configure simulation environments in Gazebo
- Implement Unity-based digital twin systems
- Integrate simulation with real-world robotics
- Model robot dynamics and physics accurately
- Transfer learning between simulation and reality

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Gazebo Environment Creation
Create a complete simulation environment with a humanoid robot and various obstacles.

**Requirements:**
- Design a world file with multiple objects
- Configure robot model with proper URDF/SDF
- Implement sensor configurations (LIDAR, cameras, IMU)
- Test navigation and manipulation tasks

### Exercise 2: Physics Simulation
Implement accurate physics simulation for a humanoid robot performing basic movements.

**Requirements:**
- Configure joint dynamics properly
- Implement contact sensors
