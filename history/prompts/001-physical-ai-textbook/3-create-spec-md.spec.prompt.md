## Prompt

Create spec.md file for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project based on the requirements in the Hackathon documentation.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created a comprehensive spec.md file for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. The specification includes:
- Project overview with purpose, goals, and target audience
- Core requirements including AI/Spec-driven book creation and RAG chatbot development
- Bonus requirements for subagents, authentication, personalization, and translation
- Technical architecture details
- Learning outcomes and success criteria
- Constraints, non-goals, and risk analysis

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification document for the textbook project
- 🧪 Tests: Validated file creation and content completeness
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan development based on this specification
- 🧠 Reflection: The specification comprehensively covers all requirements from the hackathon document

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All requirements from hackathon document included
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation based on this specification
